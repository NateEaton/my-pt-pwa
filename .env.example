# My PT PWA - Production Environment Configuration Template

# =============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT PATHS
# =============================================================================

# Production deployment directory (used by deploy.sh)
# Update this path to match your production web server directory
PROD_DEPLOY_DIR=

# Development deployment directory (used by deploy.sh)
# Update this path to match your development web server directory
DEV_DEPLOY_DIR=

# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================

# - VITE_WORKER_URL requires the VITE_ prefix to be accessible in the frontend
# - Deploy paths are only used by the deploy.sh script, not by the application
# - After updating .env, restart your development server for changes to take effect
# - The .env file should never be committed to version control
