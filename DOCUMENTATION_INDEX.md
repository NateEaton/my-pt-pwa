## 📋 Documentation Best Practices

### Adding New Documentation

When creating new documentation files:

1. **Choose the Right Location**
   - **Root directory**: README.md and DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md only
   - **_notes directory**: All specs, proposals, guides, and planning documents
   - **_notes/_archive**: Outdated or superseded documents

2. **Use Standard Headers**
   ```markdown
   # Document Title

   **Status:** [✅ IMPLEMENTED | 🔄 PLANNING | ⚠️ SUPERSEDED | ✅ CANONICAL REFERENCE]
   **Date/Last Updated:** YYYY-MM
   **Related Commits:** commit-hash, commit-hash
   **Notes:** Brief description of implementation status or context
   ```

3. **Status Indicators**
   - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Feature/proposal has been completed
   - 🔄 **PLANNING**: Currently in planning phase
   - ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED**: Implementation took a different approach
   - ✅ **CANONICAL REFERENCE**: Authoritative reference document

4. **Link Related Documents**
   - Cross-reference related specifications
   - Link to commits that implement proposals
   - Reference superseding documents when archiving

### Updating Existing Documentation

- Add implementation status when proposals are completed
- Move outdated documents to `_notes/_archive`
- Update this index when adding or removing documentation
- Maintain the archive README with archival reasons
